### Contribute to the iPhone 11 Register Fuzzing Project

Reference: M1 Apple Silicon SPRR Permission Checks https://github.com/xsscx/macos-research/tree/main/sprr

This Public Domain Repo is meant to Document the Results of Testing the iPhone 11 Registers. I can not find any similar resource.

IF you are Landing here, the Code is run on an Apple Security Research Device. 

Please contribute Code and Knowledge into the Public Domain.

The Code is CopyPasta from Sven Peter and I'm in the process of (slowly) refactoring the Code for iOS and the SRD. If you have ideas, or Code, and want to help get results, please make a PR, Issue or Discussion.

Note - I'm in learning mode, not a ninja. Your _input_ is requested.

Thank You
