### SRD Code Repo

Hello! This is my SRD Repo and the iPhone 11 Public Domain Register Fuzzing Project using the Apple Security Research Device, the Apple SRD.

Please contribute your Code, Project, Comments, Pro Tips or anything.... Open an Issue or PR.

Initial Commits contain the SPRR Code by Sven Peter and a TFTP Server ripped and canabalized for the SRD. TFTP Server & Client work perfectly for iOS 14.3 -> 14Beta7.

### iPhone 11 SPRR Permission Configuration Register (EL0) SPRR_PERM_EL0 s3_6_c15_c1_5 Check & Other iPhone 11 Register Fuzzing Code

Caveat - This Code is targeted to Apple Security Research Device Holders and Your Mileage May Vary if you do not posess a SRD.

On May 6, 2021 a Post by Sven Peter about Apple Silicon Hardware Secrets: SPRR and Guarded Exception Levels (GXF) at URL https://blog.svenpeter.dev/posts/m1_sprr_gxf/ appeared in my Timeline. I had just been reviewing https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1/blob/main/tools/apple_regs.json.
