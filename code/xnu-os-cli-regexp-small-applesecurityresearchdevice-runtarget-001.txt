# This File is used by the 2021 Apple Security Research Device Cohort to aid in reconstruction of Crash Events for LLDB, Hopper, Burp Suite and other Tooling.
# File established August 16 2021 and will grow over time
#
# This is the small version, working on a larger commit from Strings and Burp Suite
# Note that I have Burp Suite Hooked to the SRD and Capture Crash Data thru Burp and related Tooling 
# ... often because the Crashes evade Apple Crash Reporter and most other tools :->|
