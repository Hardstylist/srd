This is a sample cryptex with various files included as examples.

Some of the code is compiled to Crash.

How do it work?
If you have read the Makesfile and Documentation thenyou can download the dmg and put it in ../example-cryptex/ and use it. I'll Post a How-to here and on https://srd.cx with look at hand-rolling a cryptex, but, its very easy.. just look at the example in the Makefile.. this DMG has Toybox Unstripped for Debugging.. Its critical to have the Unstripped.. how can you see anything??? (cough).

So rip out the code and then start hand-rolling, or just wait for my CopyPasta Instructions... soon..

Do you want your Code loaded on an Example Cryptex for the SRD Cohort?
